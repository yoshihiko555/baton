"""UserPromptSubmit hook: block prompts that contain secret-like patterns.

Reads the Codex hook payload (JSON) from stdin, scans the ``prompt`` field
for common secret patterns (API keys, tokens, private key blocks), and
exits with code 2 (block) if any pattern is detected. Only the matched
pattern *name* is reported on stderr; the matched value itself is never
echoed back.

Fail-open: if stdin cannot be parsed as JSON, or no ``prompt`` field is
present, the hook exits 0 (allow) rather than blocking.

def _reexec_under_target_interpreter() -> None:
    """Re-exec this hook under $AI_ORCHESTRA_PYTHON if set (Issue #345).

    Codex CLI spawns this hook via a literal ``python3 <path>`` command in
    ``.codex/hooks.json``. Which interpreter ``python3`` resolves to depends
    on the spawn environment's PATH (e.g. a version-manager shim vs. the
    system interpreter in a non-interactive shell), which is out of this
    hook's control. When ``AI_ORCHESTRA_PYTHON`` is set to a known-good
    interpreter (``codex_run.py`` / ``codex_review.py`` set it to their own
    ``sys.executable`` before invoking ``codex exec``), re-exec under it so
    the hook body runs with a predictable interpreter regardless of how
    ``python3`` resolved.

    No-op (no behavior change) when the variable is unset, already the
    running interpreter, the target path is missing, or a re-exec already
    happened once (guarded by the sentinel below).

    The "already the running interpreter" check compares the raw executable
    paths (``target == sys.executable``), not ``os.path.realpath()`` of
    each. A venv's ``bin/python`` is commonly a symlink to a base
    interpreter; comparing resolved paths would make the venv and its base
    interpreter look identical even though ``sys.prefix`` and site
    configuration differ, silently skipping the intended re-exec into the
    venv (Issue #345 follow-up). Comparing raw paths means any mismatch
    (including a venv symlink case) triggers a re-exec; the sentinel above
    still prevents infinite re-exec loops.

    LIMITATIONS: this is a self-referential trust bootstrap, not a hardening
    guarantee. The decision of whether to switch interpreter runs inside the
    very PATH-resolved ``python3`` process it is trying to route around. If
    that interpreter is attacker-influenced (a version-manager shim,
    ``.python-version``, a malicious ``sitecustomize.py``, etc. -- none of
    which are covered by the ``.claude/orchestra.json`` ``codex_file_hashes``
    ledger), the attacker can patch ``os.execv``, strip
    ``AI_ORCHESTRA_PYTHON`` from the environment, or otherwise run arbitrary
    code before this function is ever reached, defeating the re-exec before
    it happens. This is not a new privilege escalation
    (``AI_ORCHESTRA_PYTHON`` sits at the same trust level as PATH; the
    PATH-hijack exposure predates this re-exec), but it does not make the
    hook robust against a deliberately substituted interpreter -- it only
    narrows the common case of an unexpected/stale PATH resolution. Pinning
    an absolute interpreter path directly inside ``.codex/hooks.json``
    (which *is* covered by the hash ledger) would close this remaining gap,
    but trades away the current machine-independent distribution/sync
    model; that is a follow-up trade-off decision, not part of this fix.
